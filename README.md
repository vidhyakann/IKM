**Assignment 2: Data Aggregation and Analysis**

**Objective:** Test aggregation and querying skills using Python and SQL without requiring a pre-existing database.

**Problem Statement:**
You need to analyze transaction data stored in memory. Create the mock data within the script.

**Tasks:**
1. Generate data for:

  	● users: 50 users with fields user_id and name.
  
  	● transactions: 500 transactions with fields transaction_id, user_id,amount, transaction_date (random dates within the last year).

2. Write a Python script to:
   
    ● Calculate the total transaction amount for each user.
   
    ● Identify the top 5 users with the highest total spending.
   
    ● Calculate the total number of transactions in the last 3 months.

3. Print the results to the console in a tabular format.

**Deliverables:**

		● Python script implementing the solution.
		● Console output showing results.
		● Video demonstration of functionality and code walkthrough
